Cause
-----

A write-only property is annotated with the ``[Export]`` attribute. Write-only properties
can't be exported.

Rule description
----------------

Godot doesn't allow exporting write-only properties.

.. code-block:: csharp

    private int _backingField;

    // Write-only properties can't be exported.
    [Export]
    public int InvalidProperty { set => _backingField = value; }

    // This property can be exported because it has both a getter and a setter.
    [Export]
    public int ValidProperty { get; set; }

How to fix violations
---------------------

To fix a violation of this rule, make sure the property declares
both a getter and a setter, or remove the ``[Export]`` attribute.

When to suppress warnings
-------------------------

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Write-only members can't be exported so
they will be ignored by Godot, resulting in runtime errors.
