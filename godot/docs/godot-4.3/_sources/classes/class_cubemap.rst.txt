Six square textures representing the faces of a cube. Commonly used as a skybox.

Description
-----------

A cubemap is made of 6 textures organized in layers. They are typically used for faking reflections in 3D rendering (see :ref:`ReflectionProbe<class_ReflectionProbe>`). It can be used to make an object look as if it's reflecting its surroundings. This usually delivers much better performance than other reflection methods.

This resource is typically used as a uniform in custom shaders. Few core Godot methods make use of **Cubemap** resources.

To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the Godot Editor import presets.

\ **Note:** Godot doesn't support using cubemaps in a :ref:`PanoramaSkyMaterial<class_PanoramaSkyMaterial>`. You can use `this tool <https://danilw.github.io/GLSL-howto/cubemap_to_panorama_js/cubemap_to_panorama.html>`__ to convert a cubemap to an equirectangular sky map.
